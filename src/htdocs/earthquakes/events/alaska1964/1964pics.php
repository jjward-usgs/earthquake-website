	The waterfront at Seward a few months after the earthquake,
	looking north. Note the "scalloped" shoreline left by the
	underwater landslides that severed tracks in the railroad yard
	which dangle over the landslide scarp and the windrow-like
	heaps of railroad cars and other debris thrown up by the
	tsunami waves. Alaska.

	Uplifted sea floor at Cape Cleare, Montague Island,
	Prince William Sound, in the area of greatest recorded
	tectonic uplift on land (33 feet). The very gently
	slopping flat rocky surface with the white coating
	which lies between the cliffs and the water is about a
	quarter of a mile wide. It is a wave cut surface that
	was below sea level before the earthquake. The white
	coating consists of the remains of calcareous marine
	organisms that were killed by
	desiccation when the wave cut
	surface was lifted above the high tide during the earthquake.

	Uplifted dock on Hinchinbrook Island, Prince William Sound.
	Land in this area rose about 8 feet during the earthquake,
	and the dock can now be used only at extremely high tides.

	The stumps in the foreground are part of an ancient forest
	on Latouche island, Prince William Sound, that was
	submerged below sea level and buried in prehistoric times.
	Tectonic uplift of 9 feet during the earthquake raised
	these stumps above sea level once again, demonstrating
	that the area is tectonically restless.

	The amount of tectonic uplift on Glacier Island, Prince
	William Sound, was shown by the upper limit to which
	algae of the intertidal zone are on this sea cliff before
	and after the earthquake. The top of the band of green
	(still living) algae is near present (post earthquake)
	mean high tide. The top of the band of brown (desiccated)
	algae marks the approximate position of mean high tide
	before the earthquake. The difference in height between
	the top of the bands of living and of desiccated algae
	(3 feet) is a measure of the amount of tectonic uplift
	in this area.

	View southwest along the Hanning Bay fault scarp on southwest Montague
	Island in Prince William Sound. The Hanning Bay fault was reactivated
	during the earthquake. Its trace is marked by 10 to 15 feet high bedrock
	scarp which trends obliquely across the field of view from the right
	foreground to the left background. The fault trace lies between the
	uplifted wave cut surface that is coated white by desiccated calcareous
	marine organisms and borders the open ocean and the area of brown sand
	and silt in the cove. The ground northwest of the fault (right side of
	photo) was displaced upward as much as 16 feet with respect to the ground
	southeast of the fault during the earthquake, but both sides of the fault
	were uplifted with respect to sea level due to general tectonic uplift
	of the region. The fault plane dips steeply NW, or is vertical.

	The Hillside apartment building in Anchorage was severely
	damaged by the earthquake and has been razed. It was a
	split-level, five story building with steel posts and
	lintels, concrete floor slabs, and unreinforced concrete
	block walls and partitions.

	One span of the "Million Dollar" truss-bridge of the former
	Copper River and Northwestern Railroad was dropped into the
	Copper River by the earthquake, and the other truss spans
	were shifted on their piers.

	The earthquake shifted the steel trusses of the Copper
	River and Northwestern Railroad bridge near Round Island
	from 1 to 2 feet. This view shows one of the displaced
	trusses, which pounded against an adjacent steel girder
	span. The girder span was moved to the right, its
	concrete pedestal was rotated, and the girder span almost
	fell into the river. Note the shortening indicated by
	buckling of the guardrail.

	A subsidence trough (or graben) formed at the head of the
	"L" Street landslide in Anchorage during the earthquake.
	The slide block, which is virtually unbroken ground to the
	left of the graben, moved to the left. The subsidence
	trough sank 7 to 10 feet in response to 11 feet of
	horizontal movement of the slide block. The volume of the
	trough is theoretically equal to the volume of the void
	created at the head of the slide by movement of the slide
	block. A number of houses seen in this photograph were
	undercut or tilted by subsidence of the graben. Note also
	the collapsed Four Seasons apartment building
	and the undamaged three story
	reinforced concrete frame building beside it, which are on
	the stable block beyond the graben.

	Trees up to 24 inches in diameter and between 88 and 101 feet above

	The rails in this approach to a railroad bridge near the
	head of Turnagain Arm were torn from their ties and
	buckled laterally by channelward movement of the river
	banks during the earthquake. The bridge was also
	compressed and developed a hump from vertical buckling.

<p>

	The rails were buckled by lateral movement of the embankment fill
	toward an underlying culvert, which had collapsed.

	The Turnagain Heights landslide in Anchorage, occurred along a
	steep bluff fronting Knik Arm of Cook Inlet. Its length, which
	is parallel to the bluff, was about 1.5 miles; its width was
	about .25 to .50 miles. This landslide reduced to rubble many
	of the finer homes of the city. Failure here, and in the
	"L" Street, Fourth Avenue, and Government Hill landslides in
	Anchorage occurred on horizontal or near horizontal slip surfaces
	in the Bootlegger Cove Clay, a marine silt of Pleistocene age.

	This reinforced concrete deck of highway bridge across Twenty
	Mile River near Turnagain Arm of Cook Inlet fell into the
	river during the earthquake; the adjacent steel railroad
	bridge survived with only minor damage. Both bridges were
	founded on thick deposits of soft alluvium and tidal flat
	mud, and were subjected to severe seismic vibration.
	During the earthquake some of the concrete deck sections
	hit the underlying wood pilling with sufficient force to
	drive the bare ends of the wood piles through the concrete
	deck.

	The marquee of the Denali Theater, which was in the graben
	of the Fourth Avenue landslide in Anchorage, subsided
	until it came to rest on the sidewalk in front of the
	theater, which was on ground that was not involved in the
	landslide.

	This truck at Lowell Point, 2 miles from Seward, was bent
	around a tree by the surge waves generated by the
	underwater landslides along the Seward waterfront. The
	truck was about 32 feet above water level at the time of
	the earthquake.

	Collapse of Fourth Avenue near C Street, Anchorage, due to
	earthquake caused landslide. Before the earthquake, the
	sidewalk at left, which is in the graben, was at street level
	on the right. The graben subsides 11 feet in response to 14
	feet of horizontal movement. Anchorage district, Cook Inlet region,
	Alaska. 1964.

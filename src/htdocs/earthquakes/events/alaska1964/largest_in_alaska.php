	This great earthquake and ensuing tsunami took 131 lives (tsunami 122,
	earthquake 9), and caused about $2.3 billion in property loss (in 2013 dollars; equivalent to $311 million in 1964).
	Earthquake effects were heavy in many towns,
	including Anchorage, Chitina, Glennallen, Homer,
	Hope, Kasilof, Kenai, Kodiak, Moose Pass, Portage,
	Seldovia, Seward, Sterling, Valdez, Wasilla, and
	Whittier.

	Anchorage, about 120 kilometers northwest of the
	epicenter, sustained the most severe damage to property.
	About 30 blocks of dwellings and commercial buildings
	were damaged or destroyed in the downtown
	area. The J.C. Penney Company building was damaged
	beyond repair; the Four Seasons apartment
	building, a new six-story structure, collapsed; and
	many other multistory buildings were damaged
	heavily. The schools in Anchorage were almost devastated.
	The Government Hill Grade School, sitting astride a huge
	landslide, was almost a total loss.
	Anchorage High School and Denali Grade School
	were damaged severely. Duration of the shock was
	estimated at 3 minutes.
</p>
<p>
	Landslides in Anchorage caused heavy damage.
	Huge slides occurred in the downtown business
	section, at Government Hill, and at Turnagain Heights.
	The largest and most devastating landslide occurred
	at Turnagain Heights. An area of about 130 acres
	was devastated by displacements that broke the ground
	into many deranged blocks that were
	collapsed and tilted at all angles. This slide destroyed
	about 75 private houses. Water mains and gas,
	sewer, telephone, and electrical systems were
	disrupted throughout the area.
</p>
<p>
	The earthquake was accompanied by vertical
	displacement over an area of about 520,000
	square kilometers. The major area of uplift trended
	northeast from southern
	Kodiak Island to Price William Sound and trended
	east-west to the east of the sound. Vertical displacements
	ranged from about 11.5 meters of uplift to 2.3 meters
	of subsidence relative to sea level. Off the southwest
	end of Montague Island, there was absolute vertical
	displacement of about 13 - 15 meters. Uplift also occurred
	along the extreme southeast coast of Kodiak Island,
	Sitkalidak Island, and over part or all of Sitkinak
	Island. This zone of subsidence covered about
	285,000 square kilometers, including the north and west parts of
	Prince William Sound, the west part of the Chugach
	Mountains, most of Kenai Peninsula, and almost all
	the Kodiak Island group.
</p>
<p>
	This shock generated a tsunami that devastated
	many towns along the Gulf of Alaska, and left serious damage
	at Alberni and Port Alberni, Canada, along
	the West Coast of the United States (15 killed), and
	in Hawaii. The maximum wave height recorded was
	67 meters at Valdez Inlet. Seiche action in rivers, lakes,
	bayous, and protected harbors and waterways along
	the Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Texas caused minor
	damage. It was also recorded on tide gages in Cuba
	and Puerto Rico.
</p>
<p>
	This great earthquake was felt over a large area of
	Alaska and in parts of western Yukon Territory and
	British Columbia, Canada.
